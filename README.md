# LifeForage Delta #
Genetics Made Simple

## Overview ##
LifeForage delta is an old project of mine, that I spent quite a bit of time on about a year ago. I decided to port a lot of my old projects to github, so  naturally this was one of the ones I gravitated to.
While LifeForage may seem like a complex project in theory, in reality it isn't. Spend some time sifting throug the code and eventually things make sense. If you need help understanding the meaning of a function, the othertests are projects that I created using every neccesary feature of the engine. LifeForage can be used on it's own as a "demo", however it is also easy for you to use the built in functions to try to make an ecosystem of your own! Also as a note, a lot of the genetics code is done by @CoderKid (idk what their github tag is, so I'll update that when I ask them today). Until then, happy coding

## Built-in Features ##
Organism Level 1 - Not comatible with any existing levels of LifeTurn

Organism Level 2 - Compatible with Lifeturn V1
Features:
* Starts with existing population of 4 unique organisms (based on genome size, and interpretation)
* Shows population values
* Basic neural network for 2C
* Decomposers
* Preset genomes for all organisms
* Evolution
* LifeForage mutation engine
Organism Feature Level 1 is NOT compatible with any other LifeTurns. 

Organism Level 3 - Compatible with Lifeturn V2
Features:
* Starts with existing population of 1 unique organism
* Prints individual organism genomes
* Other data presented (Main programmer's note: I don't actually know what I did, this project is from a year ago. genome_decoder.py is relatively well commented though and handles most of the printing, so probably check that out)
* Preset default genome
* Evolution
* LifeForage mutation engine

Organism Level 3 - Compatible with Lifeturn V3 - BETA
Features:
* Starts with existing population of 1 unique organism
* Prints organism genome of the HIGHEST POPULATION VALUE
* Automatic lineage tracking
* Population traccking for highest lineage
* Population tracking for total creature values
* Preset default genome
* Evolution
* LifeForage mutation engine
World Enviornment V0 - Compatible with Lifeturn V3 - ALPHA
Features:
* Photosynthesis effectiveness simulatiion
* Natural disasters
* Natural disaster customization.

## Othertest ##
In general, othertests are used simply to add on to a lot of what the main project does.
There are currently only 2 othertests, that can be run with othertest keys "20S" and "16D"
